# Resolvents

This was one of my homeworks for the [Logics for Computer Science][course]
course in my first semester of collage.

It has an interesting story. This homework, though by itself insignifiant,
helped mark an important point in my development: proving that anything that can
be done by a program isn't worth doing by hand.

I wasn't very good at theory since I wasn't inclined towards it. I might have
failed this course if not for the fact that the teaching assistent I had decided
to switch from blackboard exercises to letting us pick and solve our exercise on
his wiki. I read the email late and picked the only remaining exercise. It
required writing a program (in any language) that finds resolvents for any
specified formulas. While other exercises required finding resolvents for given
formulas by hand, this was the only exercise that required writing a program.

I wrote this program in Python and tested it on the exercises of my colegues. I
was able to show that some of them were wrong even though they got a full mark
for it. In retrospect this was kind of a dick move.

This influenced my attitude toward certaing simple games. I would rather write a
general solution to them than play them by hand. I guess some might call this
cheating.

It also influenced my desire towards automating everything in software
development.
